## ÔøΩ How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Java Swing (included with JDK)

### Quick Start
```bash
# Compile all files
javac *.java

# Start the server (in one terminal)
java Server

# Start clients (in separate terminals)
java AdvancedClient
```

### Detailed Instructions

#### 1. Compile the Project
```bash
javac Server.java AdvancedClient.java
```

#### 2. Start the Chat Server
```bash
java Server
```
- Click "Start Server" to begin accepting connections on port 12345
- Monitor all server activity in the log area
- View connected clients in the client list
- Server shows real-time timestamps for all events

#### 3. Connect Chat Clients
```bash
java AdvancedClient
```
- Enter your desired username
- Set server address (default: localhost) and port (default: 12345)
- Click "Connect" to join the chat room
- Start chatting with other connected users!

## üí¨ Chat Features

### Message Types
- **Regular Messages**: `[HH:mm:ss] Username: Hello everyone!`
- **System Messages**: `[HH:mm:ss] * Welcome to the chat, John!`
- **Join Notifications**: `[HH:mm:ss] *** Alice joined the chat ***`
- **Leave Notifications**: `[HH:mm:ss] *** Bob left the chat ***`

### Commands
- `/list` - Show all connected users
- `/quit` - Leave the chat room

### User Interface
- **Connection Panel**: Server settings, username, and connection controls
- **Chat Area**: Main message display with timestamps and formatting
- **User List**: Shows all online users with live count updates
- **Message Input**: Send messages with Enter key or Send button
- **Status Indicators**: Visual connection status (green/red)

## üîß Technical Details

### Server Architecture
- **ServerSocket**: Accepts incoming client connections on port 12345
- **ExecutorService**: Manages thread pool for client handlers
- **ConcurrentHashMap**: Thread-safe storage of connected clients and usernames
- **Message Broadcasting**: Efficient message distribution to all clients
- **Swing EDT**: Proper GUI updates on Event Dispatch Thread

### Client Architecture
- **Socket Connection**: TCP connection to chat server
- **Message Reader Thread**: Dedicated thread for receiving messages
- **Protocol Parser**: Parses structured messages (CHAT|timestamp|sender|message)
- **Swing Components**: Modern GUI with custom styling and layout
- **Auto-scroll**: Chat area automatically scrolls to latest messages

### Message Protocol
```
CHAT|14:30:25|Alice|Hello everyone!
JOIN|14:30:15|Bob joined the chat
LEAVE|14:35:42|Alice left the chat
SYSTEM|14:30:10|Welcome to the server!
USERLIST|14:30:30|Alice,Bob,Charlie
```

## üé® UI Features

### Server Interface
- Clean, professional server management interface
- Real-time activity log with timestamps
- Connected clients list with live updates

## üåü Key Improvements Over Basic Socket Programming

1. **From Echo Server to Group Chat**: Messages are broadcast to all users instead of just echoing back
2. **User Management**: Proper username handling and user tracking
3. **Real-time Updates**: Live user list and connection status updates
4. **Professional UI**: Modern, polished interface instead of console
5. **Message Formatting**: Structured messages with timestamps and types
6. **Join/Leave Notifications**: Users see when others join or leave
7. **Thread Safety**: Proper synchronization for concurrent operations
8. **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of connection losses and errors

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

- **Private Messaging**: Direct messages between specific users
- **File Sharing**: Send images, documents, and files
- **Message History**: Persistent chat history across sessions
